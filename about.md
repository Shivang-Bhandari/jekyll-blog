I’m a Front-End Developer with an year of experience. I have worked on Research Projects under the Research Department of my University, and also pursue Free-Lancing from time to time.

Until recently, I was the Lead-Web-Developer for the ACM Student Chapter, Chitkara University. I handled the Website Updates, Upgrades and Maintained the overall Dynamics. While at my position I also replaced the old website with a new one for the Student Chapter which was maintained by me till September 2016.

Currently, I Lead Front-End at Udacity for College Community in Chitkara University. Being one of the Core Members in the Community, I Handle promotions, Manage Content and Assist in Workshops on Front-End in University.

My Peer group and my Seniors know me as a highly creative developer who can always be trusted to come up with a new approach. But I know that the requirements come first, and I never try to impose my ideas on others. Instead, I spend a lot of time understanding what is required of me before suggesting ideas. I can (and often do) work well alone, but I’m at my best collaborating with others.

I am pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science Engineering from Chitkara University.

I’m currently freelancing while I pursue new opportunities and can be reached either through this profile, email at pump382156@gmail.com or by phone at +91-9988442638
